# Blood-Bank-Management-System

The Blood Bank Management System is a Java-based web application designed to manage and maintain the records of blood donors, recipients, and staff members associated with a blood bank. The system stores detailed information about the donors, such as their name, age, blood type, and contact details, as well as information about the recipients and their medical history. The system also maintains a record of the blood inventory, including the type of blood, the quantity available, and the quality of the blood.

Using the system, staff members can quickly and easily search for available blood and make it available to patients in need, which helps save time and ultimately save lives. The user-friendly interface of the system was generated by Java Swing, and the data is stored in an MSSQL database, which ensures the reliability and scalability of the system. The Blood Bank Management System is a crucial tool for any blood bank organization that needs to manage its resources effectively and efficiently.
